I can't even apply form low-interest loan because i don't see any source from which i will be able to pay even that amount.If there would have any way possible by which i could support myself for this course ,I would have already done it.only possible way seems is financial aid because my college fees are also paid by the scholarship which i got.i am somehow carrying myself and working hard to improve my status by gaining skills.It will be really very helpful if i get to take this course.i will be ever thankful to coursera for providing me this great opportunity.
