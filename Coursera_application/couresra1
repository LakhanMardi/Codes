sir,I belong to very poor family background and my parents cannot affords to gives me amount required to take this courses , this  seems to be too much costly for me .My father is a normal daily wages worker his earnings are somehow just sufficient to meet the daily expense of the family so, he cannot afford my fee to take this course ,even my college fees are managed from the scholarship which i got.  I am currently pursuing  my b.tech  in electronics engineering from  NIT Jamshedpur ,INDIA ,  (an institution of national importance under government of india) . From the limited resources which i got ,i managed to crack a national level exam ,IIT-JEE MAINS and IIT-JEE ADVANCED to get admission in this reputed college competing among 1.5 million students . if i get the opportunity to  join this  course  , I will be able to improve my skills .there is no other way for poor students like me to get the knowledge and skills  
financial aid only seems the possible way,without it i will certainly not be able to improve myself. I will be very thankful to Coursera if they give this opportunity to take this course.
